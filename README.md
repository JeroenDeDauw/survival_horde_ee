# Survival Horde Entropy Edition

A survival map for [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever][FAF] that supports 1 to 4 players.

Enemy units come from the top via 4 lanes, leading to the 4 player bases. When playing with
fewer players, the unoccupied lanes will not receive any units. By default the goal is for a
single ACU to survive till the victory time is reached.

## Installation

**FAF Map Vault**

The easiest way to install the map is to get it via the [Forged Alliance Forever][FAF] map vault.

**From a Friend**

If the map vault does not work for you and a friend has the map, ask them to send you a copy
of their `survival_horde_ee.v0019` in `Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\Maps`.
Then place that copy into the `Maps` directory on your computer.
