# Survival Horde Entropy Edition

A survival map for [Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance Forever][FAF] that supports 1 to 4 players.

Enemy units come from the top via 4 lanes, leading to the 4 player bases. When playing with
fewer players, the unoccupied lanes will not receive any units. By default the goal is for a
single ACU to survive till the victory time is reached.
